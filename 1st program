# Question1. Create a function that takes three arguments a, b, c and returns the sum of the
# numbers that are evenly divided by c from the range a, b inclusive.
# Examples
# evenly_divisible(1, 10, 20) ➞ 0
# No number between 1 and 10 can be evenly divided by 20.
#evenly_divisible(1, 10, 2) ➞ 30
# 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
